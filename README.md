## Why ?


The FIR (Facts, Insights, and Recommendations) framework is crucial in my daily work, it provides a structured approach to analyzing data, identifying key insights, and formulating actionable recommendations. This systematic method helps me navigate complex problems more efficiently, ensuring that decisions are grounded in evidence and data-driven insights.

While Excalidraw is a useful tool for visualizing concepts and ideas, it not be adapted for accelerating the execution of the FIR framework. Excalidraw focuses more on visual representation and lacks the specialized features needed to streamline the FIR process. In contrast, a dedicated tool like factly is designed specifically for data analysis and insight extraction, making it more effective for accelerating the execution of the FIR framework and enhancing overall productivity.

## Vision

factly aims to hamonize the way organizations and individuals conduct discoveries. factly provides a dynamic platform for extracting actionable insights from multiples types of data sets using The FIR (Facts, Insights, and Recommendations) framework. Our vision is to create a tool that not only simplifies data analysis but also empowers users to make informed decisions based on reliable insights.

## Note on MVP Status
As of now, the MVP of factly is a work in progress. It's not functional yet, but Iam getting there. So, stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute if you're up for a bit of a challenge!

### Journey
Ah, the joys of programming! When I first started working on factly, I had this brilliant idea to use React. Little did I know that my useRef hook would become my best friend and my weard nightmare, as I tried to track the positions of cards like a detective on a stakeout.

Then there were the lines, oh the lines! Not the poetic kind, but divs stretched out across the screen, which turned out to be quite the ordeal to manage.

And let's not forget my decision to put all the code into a single file, App.tsx. Some call it madness; I call it focused chaos. Maintenability? Pfft, that's a problem for Future Me. For now, I relish in the simplicity of a single-file symphony, a cacophony of code that somehow harmonizes into a working application.

So, come join me in this quirky quest, and let's make factly not just functional, but fun!
