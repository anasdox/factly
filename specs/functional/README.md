# Functional Specifications

This directory contains functional specifications in Gherkin format (`.feature` files).

## Rules (from AGENTS.md)

- One feature per file
- Scenarios describe behavior only (no technical details)
- Each scenario MUST have `@fsid:FS-<ScenarioTitleCamelCase>`
- Each feature MUST include explicit non-goals
- Functional specs MUST be user-validated before moving to technical specs
