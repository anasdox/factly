    "input_text": "The French real estate market is experiencing a major downturn in 2023. Transaction volume dropped by 22% in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, falling from 1.15 million to 897,000 annualized transactions. Mortgage interest rates climbed from 1.1% in January 2022 to 3.45% in September 2023, reducing household real estate purchasing power by 25%. The average price per square meter in Paris fell by 5.2% year-over-year, settling at 10,230 euros in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFirst-time buyers are the hardest hit: their share of real estate purchases dropped from 45% in 2021 to 31% in 2023. The mortgage application rejection rate reached 35%, compared to 15% in 2021. The High Council for Financial Stability (HCSF) maintains strict lending criteria: a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 35% and a maximum loan term of 25 years. Mortgage lending volume fell by 40% in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn the provinces, the situation is mixed. Mid-sized cities (Limoges, Saint-Etienne, Clermont-Ferrand) still show price increases of 3 to 7%, driven by the post-Covid remote work effect. Conversely, regional metropolises such as Lyon (-3.8%), Bordeaux (-4.1%), and Nantes (-5.6%) are experiencing significant corrections. The average time to sell increased from 64 days in 2022 to 89 days in 2023.",

Pharmaceutical R&D investments in Europe reached 41.5 billion euros in 2022, up 8.3% from 2021, but remain below the $72 billion invested in the United States. The number of clinical trials launched in Europe decreased by 14% between 2019 and 2022, falling from 4,200 to 3,612 trials per year, while the United States and China recorded increases of 7% and 23% respectively.\n\nThe European biosimilar market is growing rapidly: it reached 12.3 billion euros in 2022, a 28% increase from 2021. Biosimilars now account for 38% of the volume of biological medicines in Europe, compared to only 12% in the United States. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved 22 new biosimilars in 2022, bringing the total to 92 authorized biosimilars. The savings generated by biosimilars for European healthcare systems are estimated at 6.5 billion euros in 2022.\n\nThe shortage of essential medicines is worsening in Europe: 3,200 supply disruptions were reported in France in 2022, compared to 868 in 2018. Amoxicillin, paracetamol, and certain cancer drugs are among the most affected medicines. Europe's dependence on Asia for active pharmaceutical ingredients is critical: 80% of active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured in India and China, compared to 60% twenty years ago.",
