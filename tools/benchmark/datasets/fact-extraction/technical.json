    "input_text": "Generative artificial intelligence is transforming the global technology landscape at an unprecedented pace. The global generative AI market is estimated at $44.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $207 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.4%. OpenAI raised $10 billion from Microsoft in January 2023, bringing its valuation to $29 billion. ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in just two months after its launch, the fastest growth record in the history of consumer applications.\n\nCorporate investments in generative AI increased 4.5-fold in 2023. According to McKinsey, 55% of Fortune 500 companies launched at least one generative AI pilot project in 2023, compared to 12% in 2022. The most adopted use cases are marketing content generation (78% of projects), software development assistance (65%), and automated customer service (54%). However, 67% of executives express concerns about governance and intellectual property risks.\n\nThe race for language models is intensifying: GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), and Llama 2 (Meta) are competing for the market. The cost of training a state-of-the-art language model is estimated at between $50 and $100 million, requiring between 10,000 and 25,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The energy consumption of GPT-4's training is estimated at 50 GWh, equivalent to the annual consumption of 4,600 French households.",

    "input_text": "Cybersecurity in Europe faces growing threats and a structural skills shortage. The number of reported cyberattacks in Europe increased by 38% in 2022, reaching 10,623 major incidents according to ENISA (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity). The average cost of a data breach in Europe reached 4.35 million euros in 2022, up 12.7% from 2021. The most targeted sectors are healthcare (18% of attacks), public administrations (16%), and financial services (14%).\n\nRansomware remains the primary threat: 60% of European companies experienced at least one ransomware attack attempt in 2022. The average ransom demanded reached 1.2 million euros, but only 37% of victims actually pay. The average time to detect an intrusion is 197 days in Europe, compared to 277 days globally, thanks to NIS2 and GDPR regulations that impose notification obligations.\n\nThe cybersecurity professional shortage is critical: Europe lacks 347,000 specialists in 2023, according to (ISC)². The average salary of a cybersecurity expert in France increased by 18% year-over-year to reach 72,000 euros gross annually. The NIS2 directive, which came into effect in October 2024, extends cybersecurity obligations to 160,000 additional European entities, now covering 18 critical sectors compared to 7 previously.",
