# Ubiquitous Language

This document defines shared terms used throughout the repository. All specs and tests must use these terms consistently.

## Terms and definitions
- **Behavior**: An observable outcome expressed in terms of inputs and outputs.
- **Functional spec**: A description of behavior written in plain language and organized as scenarios with FSIDs.
- **Technical spec**: A design or interface description that supports functional behavior and uses TSIDs with FSID links.
- **Acceptance test**: A black-box test that validates behavior against functional specs.
- **Traceability**: The ability to follow a behavior from problem statement to functional spec, technical spec, and acceptance test.
- **User of Record**: The accountable decision-maker for intent and acceptance criteria.

## Forbidden or ambiguous terms
- **Fast**: Use explicit performance thresholds or remove the term.
- **Robust**: Replace with concrete error-handling or recovery expectations.
- **Easy**: Replace with measurable outcomes or user-facing tasks.
- **Secure by default**: Specify trust boundaries, inputs, and handling rules.
